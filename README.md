# FindByFlicker

A sample app which provides a feature of searching images based on users' query.

• The app uses the Flickr image search API and shows the results in a 3-column scrollable view.

• Users enter queries, such as 'kittens'.

• The app supports endless scrolling, automatically requesting and displaying
more images when the user scrolls to the bottom of the view.

• The app does not use third-party libraries.

• UI tests written.


# Access

• The code can be clone from Github or can be downloaded directly. Voila! Run the project without doing any additional work.

# Future enhancements

. Auto suggestion can be implemented when user is typing the query in the text field.
